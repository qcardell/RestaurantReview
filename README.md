# Project Purpose:
This project is part of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. The goal is to transform a static site that lacks accessibility into a fully responsive site that accessible for screen reader use. The site also a service worker to cache assets for offline use.

The map is generated by tuses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.. The list of restaurants is generated by a call to a database provided for the project.

### Loading instructions

This app must be loaded using a localhost server. If you have Python 2.x installed you can run the Python Simple Server like this.
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
For Python 3.x, the command is:
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
Or if you prefer you can use Node serve. If you do not have it installed you can install it with:
```
npm install -g serve
```
and then navigate into the build directory and run
```
serve -p 8080
```
In either case navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Changing the server portion

This app is set up to serve data from port 8000. If you have a conflict on your machine you can change the listening port in the dbhelper.js file:

```
static get DATABASE_URL() {
  const port = 8080;  // <-- change to your preferred port
  return `http://localhost:${port}/data/restaurants.json`;
}
```

    mapboxToken: 'Your-Token',
    maxZoom: 18,
